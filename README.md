# About me
 Hi, I am "Alien". I am here because I want to change my career path. Before, I have worked as a chimney sweep. I am  learning manual testing now. I am attending a course that helps me to take my first steps in the profession. I treat tasks as a challenge and I try to do them carefully. The perfectionism that is inside me makes me try to perfect myself. In the future, I would like to fulfill myself as a tester. The opportunity to improve my qualifications gives me a lot of motivation. I hope to find a place where I will learn. I am creative, open to new experiences. I have a wide range of interests. In winter I love snowboarding, in summer I put on roller skates. I like handcrafts. Manual skills allow me to fulfill myself artistically. Sometimes it is a drawing, sometimes it is a wooden table or a concrete pot. I would like to learn horse riding. to be able to roam the forests like Gerald on his horse. I try to be open to people and the world.
