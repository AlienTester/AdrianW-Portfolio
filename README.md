# About me
  Hi, I am Adrian. I am here because I want to change my career path. Before, I have worked as a chimney sweep. Now, I am learning manual testing. I am attending a course, which helps me take my first steps in the profession. In the future, I would like to fulfill myself as a tester. The opportunity to raise my qualifications gives me a lot of motivation, that is why I am looking for a place where I can develop. Working as a chimney sweep, I have learnt to talk to people. I can work in groups, but working alone is also no problem to me. Working in the office required accuracy from me, which I can use it in a manual tester profession. My perfectionism makes me pay attention to details. Ambition forces me to improve myself. I am creative and open to new experiences. I have a wide range of interests. In winter I love snowboarding, in summer I put on roller skates. I appreciate the handcrafts. Manual skills allow me to fulfill myself artistically. Sometimes it is a drawing, sometimes it is a wooden table or a concrete pot. I would like to learn horse riding. to be able to roam the forests like Gerald on his Roach. I try to be open to people and the world.
